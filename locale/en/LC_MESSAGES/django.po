"        KIT is planning a new course for the Information and Computer Engineering curriculum about open-source software (OSS). In the course, students will learn about OSS and contribute to real OSS projects on GitHub. Since OSS contributions are essentially a kind of voluntary work, the school would like to collect a list of topics that students would be willing to work on. This tool will allow you to browse the available topics for projects on GitHub and choose one for your theme as if you were a participant in KIT's new course. Topics on GitHub are special tags that show a project's purpose, subject area, community, or language. They are GitHub's solution to classifying repositories and making it easier for people to find projects that interest them.\n"
