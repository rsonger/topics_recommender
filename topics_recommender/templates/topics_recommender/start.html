        KIT is planning a new course for the Information and Computer Engineering curriculum about open-source software (OSS). In the course, students will learn about OSS and contribute to real OSS projects on GitHub. Since OSS contributions are essentially a kind of voluntary work, the school would like to collect a list of topics that students would be willing to work on. This tool will allow you to browse the available topics for projects on GitHub and choose one for your theme as if you were a participant in KIT's new course. Topics on GitHub are special tags that show a project's purpose, subject area, community, or language. They are GitHub's solution to classifying repositories and making it easier for people to find projects that interest them.

        The <strong>Search</strong> page will show a text input for you to type the name of a topic. An autocomplete menu will show you the list of matching topics as you type. If the topic does not exist, it will not appear in the autocomplete box. In that case, please check your spelling or try a different topic. Click the <strong>Submit</strong> button to see details about a topic and a list of other recommended topics.

        The search results will show a list of topic names and their descriptions. When the page first loads, the descriptions are hidden for all topics except the searched topic. Click on the name of a topic to show or hide its description. Below the description of each topic is a <strong>Search this topic</strong> link. Click that link to search for the specified topic.
